### Why This Project?

## UX

### User Stories

### Research

### Style Rationale

I've chosen to style my app in the way that I have, as 

### Wireframes

I drew my wireframes using Balsamiq. I have done separate wireframes to show my consideration of how to make my website/app responsive. The links to the files are below:

- []()

There are some differences between my wireframes and my final website. This was due to visual preferences and feedback received from my mentor, and also other users who tested my website.

## Technologies Used

- [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - I've used **Balsamiq** to create wireframes of my website/app before building it.
- [**HTML**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
    - The project uses **HTML** to create the basic elements and content of my game.
- [**SCSS**](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax)
    - The project uses **SCSS** to add custom styles to the elements and content of my game. I used **SCSS** instead of **CSS**, as it is more powerful and I used the logic to write some variables and mixins, which I called for my fonts and button styles.
- [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)
    - The project uses **CSS** to apply the custom styles created with **SCSS** to my game. The index.html file is linked directly to the main.css stylesheet.
- [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses the **Bootstrap** framework to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Bootstrap styles to my game, before adding my custom styles.
- [**JavaScript**](https://www.javascript.com/)
    - The project uses **JavaScript** from my custom script.js file to add functionality and interactivity to my game. This is the core focus of this project. The project also uses **JavaScript** from Bootstrap which is required to add functionality to the Bootstrap modal.
- [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **jQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation. This is both the standard jQuery that is built with Bootstrap components, and my custom jQuery used in my script.js file.
- [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - The project uses **Google Fonts** to style the text and suit my chosen theme.
- [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - The project uses **Font Awesome** for the instructions and sound icons in the header of my game website/app.
- [**Cloud9**](https://c9.io/login)
    - I've used **Cloud9** as the development environment to write the code for my website.
- [**Jasmine**](https://jasmine.github.io/)
    - The project uses Test Driven Development (TDD) using the **Jasmine** framework to automate some testing of my **JavaScript** code.

### Version Control

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)
    - I've used **Git** as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Cloud9, before pushing them to GitHub.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/)
    - I've used **GitHub** as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website/app in a live environment.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

I used my user stories and documented each of the steps that each user would need to complete to accomplish what they have stated. Below is the link to the document that contains this information:

- [Testing User Stories]()

### Responsive Testing

I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I made to my project and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. I also tested my game on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.

To test my whole app, I went through each feature and documented the results on a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet also documents any responsive features and confirms that they work and appear as intended on different screen sizes. The link to the spreadsheet it below:

- [Testing Checklist]()

### Additional Testing

In addition to my own testing, I also asked family members, friends and the Slack community to test my game and provide any feedback.

### HTML and CSS Validation

### Interesting Bugs Or Problems

## Deployment

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is Heroku. To deploy my website to Heroku, I used the following steps:
